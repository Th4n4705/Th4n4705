### Glad to see you here! 

I am a software developer.

Since I was a kid, I wanted to create software solutions or even sometimes games ðŸ˜œ

It's two years now, since I took that decision to build solid habits. 

So I am eager to use GitHub daily, just to share things that I made. And to make it public to people like you, which are interested in coding.

I am currently working on some assignments, and also try to code daily on LeetCode, the [LeetCodeProblems](https://github.com/Th4n4705/LeetCodeProblems) repository is about the problems that I solve there.

Feel free to contact me on [Linked In](https://www.linkedin.com/in/twakrim/) or by [E-Mail](mailto:taha.wakrim.pro@gmail.com)
