### Glad to see you here! ![visitors](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=Th4n4705)

I am a software developer.

Since i was a kid i wanted to create software solutions maybe some time games :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

It's two years now that i take that decision to build solid habits. And i think that i am late about working on github on a daily basis.

So i m eager to use github daily, just to share things that i made. And to make it public to people like you which, they are interested in coding.

I am currently working on some assignments, and also try to code daily on leetcode, the [LeetCodeProblems](https://github.com/Th4n4705/LeetCodeProblems) repository is about the problems that i solve there.

Feel free to contact me on Linked In above
